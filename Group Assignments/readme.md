# DH140 Project Proposal
## Research Question: Introduction
How have state policy decisions in response to the pandemic such as mask mandates, travel restrictions, or reopening guidelines, impacted the spread of covid? 
## Why It Matters
This research question feels important because it could provide some insight into what has seemed to help or worsen the spread of covid in different states and cities. This could help inform future policy decisions that proitize public health. It also could help in deciding how funding or resources should be allocated and what should be prioritized. 
## Spatial Components 
The two datasets being used both focus on the United States. Time matters in this project since covid data and policy decisions will be obersevred over the course of 2020. 

## Data Sources
The first dataset being used is a dataset created by the New York Times tracking cases and deaths in each state from Janurary 2020 to present and is regularly updated.
The second dataset is by Healthdata.gov that provides a view into state and county policy orders made in response to the pandemic.
