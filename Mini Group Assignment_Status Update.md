# 2020 COVID Impact Disparities 

[Project Proposal](https://github.com/annalisegtz/Class-Project/blob/main/Group%20Assignments/readme.md) 

# Status Update

General mood is well. I find that what works best is to work on the project in small chunks over time rather than in fewer longer sittings. It also reflects in 
the quality of the work in my notebooks when I am working on something over the course of the whole week rather than a few days leading up to a due dateMa. 

# Data Update

For my data sources I have a a dataset on state level cases and deaths over time starting from January 2020, one on pandemic policy responses over time by state 
and county, and spatial data file of covid testing sites in the U.S. In addition I am also using census data and looking at OpenStreet Maps data as learned from 
the past labs. I am still experiementing with these data sources so which ones will be included in the final project has not yet been decided, but I will most 
definitely will be using the cases and deaths dataset along with census data.

- State Policy Response https://healthdata.gov/dataset/covid-19-state-and-county-policy-orders

- COVID Testing Sites https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/covid-19-testing-locations

# Concerns

Major Concerns: 
- My data sets are quite large (data on the whole U.S), and I want to narrow them down to specific cites. I am still deciding whether to compare two or three cities or focus closely on one main city/state, or a mix.
- The data sets are also being collected over time so they have dates included, so I am concerned about how I should section off the data by time periods. I am considered doing something such as summer months versus winter months but am still undecided. 
- Still figuring out how to narrow the testing site data by area and present that visually 

Minor Concerns: 
- Coherent presentation of the project that makes sense from beginning to end. Right now a lot of my work has still been exploratory and experimental but I suspect a more final narrative will begin to fall into place which is why this is only a minor concern
- Unsure of how much of outside knowledge/readings on my topic to include that are unrelated to the technical aspects of the project but more humanistic/socially focused.
